README - Test Sets
================================================

Set A - images are all same size, the molecules contain only single bonds and no letters. This is the simplest set of moleules to test. Start here


Set B - images are all same size, the molecules only contain single bonds, but the molecules contain letters denoting methyl groups. (can either be 'Me' 'CH3', they mean the same thing)

Set C - images are all same size, the molecules contain all types of bonds, and many different letters. Molecules are large and complicated. recognizing this set is the end goal.

Set D - images VARY in size, they were drawn by a different person. Contain several types of bonds and different letters. Molecules are small and not too complex. There is not a key for these molecules yet...


HOW TO USE KEY TO VERIFY RESULTS:
Set A and Set B contatin a 'key.txt' file, formatted like this: 
[number]- [SMILES string]
the number corresponds to the numbers in the file names of the images in the set. the SMILES string is the standardized computer readable format for the molecule. 

In Set C, there is a key.xls file. The row number on the spreadsheet corresponds to the filename of the image in the set. There are many more lines in the file that have not been handrawn. There's a few thousand more difficult molecules to draw with the corresponding SMILES code. 

Set D does not currently have a key. May update this soon. However, at the moment, the program needs to be adjusted to work for any image size, when that is done, set D will become relevant.
